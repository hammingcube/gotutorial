* Introduction

Before you guys crucify me for blatantly ripping off [[http://blog.golang.org/][the (original) Go Blog]], let
me tell you a little more about the genesis of this blog.

The following program prints the Fibonacci numbers.

.play -edit playground/time.go /^func fibonacci/,/^func main/-1

How does it work?
